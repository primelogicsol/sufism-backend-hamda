      "html": "In inspiring interviews, you'll meet individuals whose lives have been radically reshaped by the essence of Sufism. These are not celebrities—they are awakened souls: quiet reformers, radiant artists, silent servers, and bold seekers. Each conversation is a mirror into a life transformed. Some found God in grief. Some turned their professions into paths of light. Others carry centuries-old wisdom into modern chaos."
