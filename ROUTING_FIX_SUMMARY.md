# Routing Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

The vendor login and admin login were failing with a 401 "client must authenticate itself" error.

### Root Cause

**Issue**: In `src/routers/defaultRouter.ts`, the `vendorOrderRouter` was mounted at the root path (`/`) while it had authentication middleware applied globally (`router.use(authMiddleware.checkToken)`).

Since Express matches routes in order and the vendorOrderRouter was mounted at `/` before other routers, it was catching requests to `/vendor-login` and requiring authentication before the user could even login.

### Changes Made

1. **`src/routers/defaultRouter.ts`** (Line 36):

   - **Before**: `defaultRouter.use("/", vendorOrderRouter);`
   - **After**: `defaultRouter.use("/vendor/orders", vendorOrderRouter);`
   - Now the router is mounted at a specific path instead of root, preventing it from catching login requests

2. **`src/routers/vendorRouter/vendorOrderRouter.ts`**:
   - Updated route paths to not duplicate "orders" in the path
   - **Before**: `router.get("/orders", ...)` → Would create `/vendor/orders/orders`
   - **After**: `router.get("/", ...)` → Creates `/vendor/orders` ✅

## Route Structure (After Fix)

### Vendor Auth Routes (Public - No Auth Required)

- `POST /v1/vendor-login` ✅ Login
- `POST /v1/vendor-register` ✅ Register
- `POST /v1/vendor-register/:id` ✅ Update registration

### Vendor Order Routes (Protected - Auth Required)

- `GET /v1/vendor/orders` ✅ Get all orders
- `GET /v1/vendor/orders/summary` ✅ Order summary
- `GET /v1/vendor/orders/analytics` ✅ Order analytics
- `GET /v1/vendor/orders/:orderItemId` ✅ Order details
- `PUT /v1/vendor/orders/:orderItemId/status` ✅ Update status
- `POST /v1/vendor/orders/bulk-update` ✅ Bulk update

### Vendor Shipping Routes (Protected - Auth Required)

- All routes under `/v1/vendor/shipping/*`

### Vendor Payout Routes (Protected - Auth Required)

- All routes under `/v1/vendor/payout/*`

### Vendor Onboarding Routes (Protected - Auth Required)

- All routes under `/v1/vendor/onboarding/*`

### Admin Routes

- `POST /v1/user/admin/login` ✅ Login
- All other routes under `/v1/admin/*` (Protected)

## Testing

You can now test:

1. ✅ Vendor login: `POST http://localhost:6015/v1/vendor-login`
2. ✅ Admin login: `POST http://localhost:6015/v1/user/admin/login`
3. ✅ All protected routes work after login

## Why This Happened

The `vendorOrderRouter` was imported and mounted in the defaultRouter, but because:

1. It was mounted at `/` (root path)
2. It had global authentication middleware (`router.use(authMiddleware.checkToken)`)
3. It was placed early in the route registration order

It intercepted requests before they could reach the login endpoints.

## Solution

By mounting it at `/vendor/orders` instead of `/`, the router now:

- Only handles requests that match `/vendor/orders/*`
- Doesn't intercept login requests
- Follows REST conventions (all vendor routes under `/vendor/*`)
