          "quote": "The Metaphysics of Existence and Essence",
          "explanation": "Ibn Sina distinguished existence (wujud) from essence (mahiyya), asserting that existence is granted by a necessary being (God). This aligns with quantum mechanics, where particles have potential existence until observed (collapse of the wave function)."

          "explanation": "Heisenberg discovered that the act of measurement changes a system's state, implying that observation participates in reality's formation. This resonates with Islamic metaphysics, where divine witnessing (shuhud) is what grants stability to creation."

He argues that Sufi perception (kashf) is a function of aligning human awareness with this divine field, much like quantum coherence in Bose-Einstein condensates."

The human being stands as a meeting point of all realms, containing within their consciousness the entirety of creation in microcosmic form."
